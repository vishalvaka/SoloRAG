The most common forms of IP are copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. As you start working on your company, you are likely developing multiple forms of IP: business plans and strategies, product prototypes, software code, domain names, logos, websites, sketches, drawings, algorithms, company processes, customer lists, and “negative know-how” (things you’ve learned not to do). It is not necessary to have registered your IP (i.e., patent filings, trademark filings, domain names, etc.) for it to be protected. If you have been developing the business model or product for your new company, you likely have created IP."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/atlas-purchasing-stock-with-ip-faq", "title": "Q: What is IP?", "text": "A: When incorporating your business, it is essential that you purchase your shares from the corporation. You can do so using cash or IP. Atlas makes it easy to use IP – you can click a button in our dashboard and use the IP that you are already contributing to the business during the incorporation process to purchase your shares."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/atlas-purchasing-stock-with-ip-faq", "title": "Q: What is IP?", "text": "A: Atlas follows the standard market practice of assuming that at formation, your company is worth US$0.00001 multiplied by the number of issued shares. Atlas defaults to 10,000,000 shares issued at formation. You need to purchase your shares at par value (US $0.00001 each). Atlas calculates the amount you need to pay, in either cash or with IP, to purchase your shares. For example, if you own 85.0% of the company, which is 8,500,000 shares and each share is initially worth US$0.00001, the purchase price of your shares is US$85.00."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/atlas-purchasing-stock-with-ip-faq", "title": "Q: What is IP?", "text": "Because the amount you will pay for your shares is small, newly formed companies generally assume that your existing IP is worth at least the value of the shares you are purchasing from the company. Using Atlas ensures that your contribution qualifies as a tax free exchange. If you believe that you hold IP that is worth substantially more than your shares, please seek the advice of an attorney or tax accountant."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/atlas-purchasing-stock-with-ip-faq", "title": "Q: What is IP?", "text": "A: You need to contribute your IP to the company because the company must own the IP it uses to operate. When you create a company using Atlas, all founders assign relevant IP —both IP that is developed prior to forming your company as well as the IP that will be developed after the company is formed—to the company. Future investors and potential acquirers will expect that your company owns this IP when entering into an agreement with you, and assigning your IP to your company could help you avoid future litigation over IP ownership, for example if a founder were to leave the company."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/atlas-purchasing-stock-with-ip-faq", "title": "Q: What is IP?", "text": "A: You should only contribute IP relevant to your newly formed company. For example, if you have been working on a different business idea or an artistic endeavor, such activities likely created IP that you would not want to assign to your new company. Similarly, employers—both prior and current—usually own the IP you created while working for them.  You cannot use this IP in your new business and, because you don’t own it, you cannot assign it to your new business. The legal documents you sign while incorporating a business with Atlas contribute only your IP that relates to the company. Read more from Cooley about Moonlighting"}

{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-element-faq", "title": "FAQ", "text": "Stripe Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components, like inputs and buttons, for building your checkout flow. For each payment method (credit cards, debit cards, etc.), there’s an associated Element. The Payment Element is a new component that combines individual payment method Elements into a single Element. Here's how Stripe Elements and Payment Element differ from each other: When using Elements previously, a merchant would need to build and maintain a currency/country/payment method mapping and associated logic for when to call Stripe APIs on the backend and to show/hide the Elements on the user interface (UI). This would require integrating each Element one by one. With the Payment Element, it would be possible to remove the need for a merchant to build and maintain these aspects. The integration experience starts to look like a single Element integration, the mappings, logic, presentation, and behavior are pre-built by Stripe. The trade off is slightly less customization within the UI layer than is possible today with Stripe Elements but more control than what Stripe Checkout offers. More specifically, the main differences are: - The Payment Element requires nearly the same amount of effort to integrate as another Element (e.g., the Card Element), but requires far less effort to maintain, since payment methods can be added without needing to integrate with another Element for each one. - The ability to customize styling is more limited compared to Elements today, with only our JavaScript styling API supported (not CSS). However, the majority of styling capabilities are still supported. - Because server-side confirmation isn't supported, credit cards will need to use webhooks (not the case with Elements today). However we are going to support a bypass for this on Cards. - A redirect to an order confirmation page is required for most payment methods accepted via the Payment Element, so single page web-apps will need to add a separate page for order confirmation. However, the checkout experience is still fully embedded within the merchant's site (unlike Stripe Checkout)."}

Please check directly with these platforms to find out if they currently support GrabPay, as they may have official plugins or third-party integrations that allow their users to integrate with various payment methods."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "This applies to any merchant that has authenticated with a third party integration with their Stripe secret API key . These integrations are typically called plugins, but can also have other names. Stripe defines a plugin as any integration between a third party solution and Stripe that requires a user to authenticate with their secret API keys. A plugin typically interacts with Stripe APIs either by making API calls or reacting to Stripe API events on behalf of its users. Often, plugins run code so Stripe can interact with other software (e.g. accept payments on Wordpress), but they may take other shapes too, like open-source libraries."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "Stripe is improving our security requirements for plugin developers and their users. Secret API keys can be used for any kind of API request without limitation, and give third-parties all-access to a user’s Stripe account. They are a form of account credentials, like a username and password. If bad actors obtain a secret key, they can use it to harm a merchant’s business and other parties in the Stripe ecosystem. Stripe users own the responsibility of keeping secret API keys safe. At Stripe, we take many precautions to ensure secret API keys are protected."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "Most plugins do not need all access permissions, but rather a limited set. In today’s world, risk is introduced when developers require users to manually copy their account credentials onto a third-party platform. In order to reduce fraud risk to users, developers, and Stripe, we are requiring developers to use restricted API keys or OAuth for plugin authentication."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "On January 1, 2024, Stripe added support for restricted API key and OAuth 2.0 authentication to Stripe Apps, enabling plugins to operate more securely in the ecosystem.

{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "On September 30, 2024 , Stripe is requiring all plugin developers to adopt new secure authentication methods ( restricted API Key , OAuth 2.0 , or Stripe Connect ) to protect users against fraud.

For those developers electing to use restricted API key or OAuth 2.0 via a Stripe app, their app must be reviewed and approved by Stripe prior to being published in the Stripe App Marketplace ."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "On October 29, 2024 , Stripe will begin requiring that all merchants using plugins upgrade the security of their connections by authenticating with either restricted API keys or OAuth 2.0. This is a planned upgrade to enhance the overall security of Stripe third-party integrations and comply with Stripe's latest standards. Stripe will charge a fee starting June 2025 for businesses that do not comply with this security requirement."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "For better security and control, it is essential to use restricted API keys or OAuth 2.0 instead of secret keys when authenticating with third-party services. Restricted API keys improve security by offering businesses precise control over the permissions they are granting to third-parties, ensuring third-party services access only the necessary data and actions. OAuth 2.0 is a one-click tokenized authorization that businesses provide to third-parties to integrate. Similar to restricted API keys, OAuth 2.0 offers you more control and protection over the permissions you grant third-parties. These options not only bolster protection against unauthorized access and fraud, but also streamline operations, making integrations more efficient and reliable for you to use."}
{"url": "https://support.stripe.com/questions/plugin-user-migration-guide", "title": "Untitled", "text": "On January 1, 2024, Stripe introduced additional capabilities for Stripe Apps that made plugin authorization easier and more secure.

We select a variety of projects with the help of scientific expert reviewers and use a transparent application process .

In the case of subscriptions, the Guidelines also state that businesses must disclose the quantity of product in each delivery as well as the number of deliveries, so consumers can understand the total quantity to be delivered. If notice that it is a subscription is in small or hard-to-see font located away from text such as “First Order Free” or “Free Trial,” the disclosure is more likely to be considered as a violation of the revised Specified Commercial Transactions Act. It is preferable for businesses to disclose if a subscription is indefinite, and, if so, disclose details such as quantity to be provided in a sample interval (e.g., in years) for illustrative purposes. The same applies to auto-renewing contracts. Businesses should also provide indicators when the same product is sold in different quantities, so consumers can clearly distinguish them. For example, if Product A is sold in packs of 5, 3, and 2, or in different sizes (e.g., large/800 mL, medium/500 mL, small/300 mL), it is the product descriptions that should disclose the product name and quantity, size, etc.."}

If there are additional shipping rates, these must also be disclosed.

For example, if a subscription involves a monthly delivery for 6 months, the final confirmation page must disclose the monthly payment including shipping rates, as well as the grand total for the six-months. For subscriptions that provide a special price for the initial delivery, businesses must disclose the price for that delivery and the prices for subsequent deliveries. In the case of free trials that automatically transition to a paid contract, businesses must clearly disclose in advance when the contract will transition and the amounts to be paid. In the case of indefinite contracts, it is recommended to present the total payment for a sample fixed interval (e.g., one year) for illustrative purposes."}

Lastly, we made it clear that our limitation of liability does not apply to our obligation to pay out payment processing proceeds we owe to our users."}

Many factors affect payment acceptance rates across issuers, including whether the attempted charge is made using a network token or a primary account number (PAN). To maximize approval rates, Stripe maintains a secure vault of PANs and intelligently selects whether to use a network token or a PAN for a given transaction. When a PAN is used, card account updater automatically retrieves the latest card information for any expired or reissued cards. In this way, network tokens and card account updater work together to protect billions of dollars in revenue for businesses and ensure a seamless experience for customers. In addition, having card account updater turned on helps improve tokenization rates, since network tokens can’t be provisioned using outdated PANs."}
